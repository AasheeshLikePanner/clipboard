# Vite + React + Typescript + TailWindCSS

This is an Electron template using Vite, React, Typescript and TailWindCSS. It includes hot reloading.

## Prerequisites
1. Clone the repository
1. Run ```npm install``` inside the cloned repository
1. It works on Windows but I haven't tested on neither Linux nor Mac

## For development
1. Run ```npm run dev``` - This starts the application as well as a local server on port ```3524``` 
1. You can change the server port at the ```vite.config.ts```

## For production
1. To create a production for Windows run ```npm run dist:win```
1. To create a production for Linux run ```npm run dist:linux```
1. To create a production for Mac run ```npm run dist:mac```
